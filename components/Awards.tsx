        Eventuary
          </a>  - a web app that lets University of Toronto students register for school events that match their interests by using personalized recommendations and scraping from several different event websites. It's employed with AWS Architecture like Lambda, DynamoDB, Bedrock, Kendra, and Cognito.

        I led cloud architecture design decisions and developed the entire front-end web application. It was a great time learning to use Amazon Web Services while having actual solution architects on standby (thank god for y'all).

        As winners, we're currently in talks with UofT faculty in regards to potentially implementing Eventuary into student life!
